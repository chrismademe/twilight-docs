Twilight is a Preprocessor for Twig, so if you're familiar with Twig you'll feel right at home with Twilight. In fact, you should read through the <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html">Twig for Template Designers documentation</a>, everything you can do there, you can do in Twilight, since it compiles to Twig syntax.

## How It Works

### Twilight

You write components and templates using the Twilight syntax. This is then compiled into valid Twig syntax. Things like directives and components are transformed into Twig expressions.

### Twig

Twig works by compiling your templates to PHP classes. You can read more about how Twig works on their <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/internals.html">Twig Internals</a> page.
